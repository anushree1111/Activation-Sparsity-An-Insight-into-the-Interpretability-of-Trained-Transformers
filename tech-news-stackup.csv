Today, the DJI Mini 2 — don’t call it a Mavic — is addressing some of its limitations. 
While the new $449 drone might look identical to the original, even weighing the same 249 grams (which means you don’t need to register it with the FAA), it now comes with DJI’s OcuSync 2 wireless connectivity for up to 2.5 times the wireless range and more stable connectivity. The original was unusual among DJI’s drones for relying on relatively shaky Wi-Fi, which was definitely a dealbreaker for me. 
It uses the same controller as the new Mavic Air 2, though of course you won’t get that drone’s...

In a robust show of doubling down on privacy protections, voters in the Maine city passed a measure Tuesday replacing and strengthening an existing ban on city official's use of facial recognition technology. While city employees were already prohibited from using the controversial tech, this new ban also gives residents the right to sue the city for violations and specifies monetary fines the city would have to pay out. 

Oh yeah, and for some icing on the cake: Under the new law, city officials that violate the ban can be fired. What's more, if a person discovers that ""any person or entity acting on behalf of the City of Portland, including any officer, employee, agent, contractor, subcontractor, or vendor"" used facial recognition on them, that person is entitled to no less than $100 per violation or $1,000 (whichever is greater).  Read more...

In case you haven't heard, Walmart is running early Black Friday events, with the first one taking place on Nov. 4. This sale features an awesome deal on a 65-inch 4K smart TV. It's from a brand called Onn., which is only sold at Walmart, but the pricing is seriously awesome.

We love a good Instant Pot deal, and it's even better when the price drops to below $50. At 50% off, this Walmart early Black Friday deal on the 9-in-1 Instant Pot Viva brings it to the same price that the 6-in-1 Instant Pot Lux was on Prime Day, all while giving you three extra features.

This deal comes in round one of Walmart's Black Friday Deals for Days, which launches at 7 p.m. ET on Nov. 4.

The Instant Pot Viva is almost identical to the Instant Pot Duo, but the Viva also has a sterilize setting.

This pricing is $20 lower than the Prime Day price for the same model, bringing the cost down to the same price as most of the regular Instant Pot models (the ones that can't air fry). Basically, this sale is like getting a whole air fryer for free, and who doesn't want that?

YouTube says a video claiming President Donald Trump won the election does not violate any of its policies and has allowed it to stay on the platform, despite the election not being called by major news outlets for either candidate yet. The decision stands in contrast to Twitter and Facebook’s more aggressive attempts to clamp down on misleading claims and misinformation over election results.
The video, titled “Trump Won. MSM hopes you don’t believe your eyes,” was published by pro-Trump network One American News Network (OANN) on Wednesday. YouTube says the video violates its advertising guidelines but not its content policies, so it can stay online but will run without ads, the company confirmed to The Verge. The story was first...

With Prop. 22's passage in California, Lyft, Uber, DoorDash, and other apps that rely on so-called gig workers will continue to treat those workers as independent contractors. (The SF Chronicle put the vote at 58 percent for, 41 percent against.) 

If the measure failed, the state's new(ish) employee classification law AB 5 would have turned those contractors into employees with benefits. 

So what does this mean for the rest of the country? California is often a bellwether. New York, Massachusetts, and other states considering gig economy legislation could look to its new ""hybrid"" model, in which companies give workers some limited benefits. Read more...

Life is in constant flux, but experiencing change during the extremely uncertain time we’re all going through is especially maddening. Luckily, you can still eke out some semblance of control in your web browser — this new Chrome extension created by designer Claudio Postinghel lets you replace Google’s newly redesigned but confusingly similar icons for the old ones (via Gizmodo).
When it was announced in early October, we described Google’s big rebrand of G Suite as a way to set up the search giant’s products to better compete with Microsoft Office. Yet the newly named Google Workspace brought a collection of redesigned, cohesive app icons that — in my opinion, and that of my coworkers — are very difficult to recognize from a distance.

President Donald Trump is prematurely declaring victory in a handful of hotly-contested battleground states via tweets Wednesday, challenging Twitter’s rules against making premature election result claims.
“We have claimed, for Electoral Vote purposes, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (which won’t allow legal observers) the State of Georgia, and the State of North Carolina, each one of which has a Big Trump lead,” Trump tweeted Wednesday.
Twitter started applying labels to the offending tweets shortly after they were posted. More than 1 million ballots are still to be counted in Pennsylvania, and election officials are not legally required to finish their count before Friday. Most importantly, the president has no authority to certify...

Denmark plans to cull up to 17 million mink, the country’s entire population, after reports that the animals could pass a coronavirus mutation to humans. The announcement came from Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen at a press conference, and there are currently no published scientific reports on the mutation or its effects. 
The virus has been found at over 200 mink farms in Denmark, which produces most of the world’s mink fur. Over a million animals were already culled on Danish farms in October. This summer, about 100,000 mink were culled in Spain after similar outbreaks. Outbreaks on mink farms in Utah killed thousands of animals.

Google has weighed in on concerns from new Pixel 5 owners over a visible gap between the display and the body of the phone, with the company confirming in a support thread that the gap is “a normal part of the design of your Pixel 5,” and therefore not something to be concerned about. 
Additionally, the support thread (spotted by 9to5Google) addresses what many users were most concerned about — whether that gap would compromise the Pixel 5’s water resistance (one of the key differentiators between it and the cheaper Pixel 4a), but Google says that the gap will have “no effect on the water and dust resistance or functionality of your phone.”
It’s not clear how widespread the display gap issue is on Pixel 5 devices. As various user...

Local races can go a long way toward changing how Americans get their electricity. After yesterday’s election, both the city of Columbus, Ohio, and township of East Brunswick, New Jersey, are projected to pass measures that allow their local governments, instead of utilities, to decide where residents’ power comes from. 
Boosting the growth of cheap renewable energy
These “community choice” programs are boosting the growth of cheap renewable energy and are already prying loose investor-owned utilities’ tight grip on energy markets in places like California.

Activision has detailed the file sizes of its upcoming Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, releasing across existing consoles and next-gen hardware on November 13th. And in keeping with tradition, the game is massive. Another source of pain is that for buyers of the PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X/S, the game will take up roughly an additional 40GB of space on your new solid state drive. 
Here’s the full breakdown of file sizes across platforms: 
PlayStation 4: 95GB

Democrats are calling on Twitter to suspend President Donald Trump’s Twitter account until the election is decided.
“Right now, the President’s Twitter account is posting lies and misinformation at a breathtaking clip,” Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI) tweeted Wednesday. “It is a threat to our democracy and should be suspended until all the votes are counted.”
“Suspend his account, @Twitter. This is pure disinformation,” Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-VA) tweeted Wednesday as well. “Valid votes are being counted. This is America, not Russia.”

Nov. 4 is the day after a historical election and the first leg of Walmart's three-event Black Friday Deals for Days extravaganza.

We also know it as the day that AirPods dropped below $100.

You can find the AirPods with a wired charging case for $99.99 at Amazon, but Walmart is probably the store to thank. 

Walmart wasn't shy about its plans to shave an unprecedented amount of money off the AirPods with the non-wireless charging case — the deal was displayed on the front page of their Black Friday ad, which has been out for weeks. The only caveat was that $99 wouldn't show up until the kickoff of Walmart's event at 7 p.m. EST. Surprising to no one, Amazon took one look at that and knew they had to beat Walmart to the punch.

Massachusetts voters approved a measure requiring car manufacturers to let people access vehicle data for repairs. Question 1 amends a landmark 2012 “right to repair” law in the state. After it’s adopted, manufacturers will have until car model year 2022 to install a standard open data platform. The platform will let vehicle owners and independent mechanics access telematics, wirelessly transmitted data that is typically sent directly to a remote server.
Right to repair advocates hailed the measure — which passed with 75 percent approval — as a victory. “Tuesday’s victory shows that people overwhelmingly support fair repair,” wrote iFixit’s Kevin Purdy. “And they want people they trust to fix the things they own.” As cars become...

California’s already tough privacy law is about to get a lot stronger as voters are expected to approve a ballot initiative expanding much of what the law covers this week. If approved, Proposition 24 would expand California’s privacy law to cover more sensitive data sets and establish a new state agency in charge of enforcing these rules for consumers. The result will be a higher standard for privacy in California and a powerful new state agency to take on tech companies. 
As of press time, Proposition 24 is leading with 56 percent of the vote, as reported by The Sacramento Bee. Only about 65 percent of the vote has been tallied, but poll watchers expect the measure to clear based on the early returns.

T-Mobile will pay $200 million to end an investigation by the Federal Communications Commission into misuse of funds from its low-income phone and internet subsidy program. The commission says the payment represents the “largest fixed-amount settlement” it’s ever secured to resolve an investigation.
The subsidy issues stem from Sprint before the company was acquired by T-Mobile. The commission says that more than 1 million Sprint customers on subsidized plans should have had their service cut off for non-usage. Instead, Sprint continued collecting subsidies for service it wasn’t providing for “an extended period of time.” Service providers are supposed to begin removing customers who stop using subsidized phone and internet plans after...

Twitter and Facebook have continued to restrict and label posts from President Donald Trump after yesterday’s presidential election, this time addressing a baseless claim that Democratic officials were manipulating vote counts in key states.

The radio waves — known as fast radio bursts, or FRBs — seem to have sprouted from an incredibly powerful “zombie” star lurking in our galaxy, according to three papers published in the journal Nature. Called a neutron star, the object is a super dense leftover that forms when a massive star, bigger than our own Sun, collapses in on itself. But this neutron star is...

As of early Monday morning, there was no clear winner in the 2020 presidential election. We might get an answer today? Who knows. Will democracy survive? LOL, I mean maybe? 

But we do know that New Jersey voted to legalize recreational marijuana, along with a number of other states with weed on the ballots. Then we saw this tweet.



Every single dispensary in New Jersey is going to be called, like, Da Wise Guys or Goodfellaz, and it’s gonna be a whole lot of fun.

Our broken, exhausted, internet-poisoned brains latched onto this idea. We needed something else to think about. And if you're feeling overwhelmed, tired, and stressed as hell, I recommend making some dumb Jersey dispensary puns. As a Sopranos loving workplace, we almost immediately started firing off Sopranos/generic Italian-American nonsense puns in our Slack.  Read more...

There's one remaining question for people who are looking for earbuds but aren't buying AirPods: Where do you go from here?

Price is probably a deciding factor. Despite AirPods taking a remarkable plunge to $99.99 ahead of Black Friday, Apple's headphones ain't cheap. If you're worried about losing them (or worried about your kid losing them, if this is a present for them), spending less provides some cushion.

A handful of months ago, we wrote about a deal on the OnePlus 7T that dropped its price from $599 to $499. That price has fallen considerably since, and today’s deal at Woot is evidence of that. You can get one for just $370. This is a new, unlocked model in either the “glacier blue” or “frosted silver” colorway, with 128GB of storage and support for a single SIM card. It has a one-year warranty through OnePlus and includes all original accessories. It’s a great value, considering it has the Snapdragon 855 Plus processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 90Hz refresh rate display that makes everything appear smoother on the screen.
One caveat here is that it’s the T-Mobile version of the phone, and it comes pre-loaded with T-Mobile applications. That’s...

On the service side, systems are largely designed following ‘standard’ commuting routes which often fail to address the diversity of people’s needs, generating discrimination by omission.

It’s hard to say if the voting public acted in their own interests or with the welfare of drivers in mind, though. Gig Workers Rising, a driver advocacy group, said it’s a “loss for democracy that could open…

The ballot measure mandates that drivers for Uber, Lyft and DoorDash will receive new benefits, such as minimum hourly earnings. But drivers won’t get the full protections and benefits that come with employment, as they may have had to under another law, AB5 — which originally took aim at gig work. Labor groups, which opposed the law, raised only a tenth as much money.

President Donald Trump prematurely claimed victory in the 2020 election early Wednesday morning, telling a live TV audience that he’d already won — while also threatening to take legal action against votes that have yet to be counted, even though many states are continuing to process legitimate mail-in ballots.
“Frankly, we did win this election,” Trump said, while also suggesting he would take legal action to keep further ballots from being counted.
Initially, Trump stopped short of declaring a win, instead focusing on individual states where he’s done well. Even there, however, he appears to have lied about some of the details — prompting NBC News to cut him off and fact-check him in real time:

Portland, Maine has passed a ballot initiative banning the use of facial recognition by police and city agencies. The Bangor Daily News is reporting that voters have passed a ballot initiative bolstering a ban on facial recognition by city agencies.
The initiative follows a city council vote in August, which put a preliminary ban in place as an ordinance. Today’s vote replaces that ordinance with a stronger measure, which cannot be revoked for at least five years. 
The ordinance was placed on the ballot earlier this year by the Southern Maine chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America, as part of a raft of other progressive initiatives including a $15 minimum wage and new limits on rent increases.
The new measure also adds concrete...

Earlier in the night, both Twitter and Facebook chose to label a message — identical on both platforms — from Trump reading, “We are up BIG, but they are trying to STEAL the Election. We will never let them do it. Votes cannot be cast after the Polls are closed!” Twitter also placed sharing restrictions on the tweet.

The world of online shopping is slowly building up to Black Friday, and the deals have already started to trickle in. We're not at the frenzied stage of deals just yet, but there are definitely some good opportunities to save.

Black Friday isn't always the best time to save on subscription services like Netflix, Disney+, and Spotify, but there are deals out there if you know where to look. For example, this is a particularly good time to sign up to Amazon's music streaming service, as new customers can get a three-month subscription to Amazon Music Unlimited for absolutely nothing.

Despite the growth of Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok, good old Facebook still reigns supreme as the most-used social network around. Crazy, right? With 2.45 billion monthly active users, it's clearly doing something right. Perhaps, now hear us out, it's all in how it's built.

Facebook, along with Wikipedia, Yahoo, Flickr, Tumblr, and 80% of websites all over the web are built with PHP – a server-side coding language used to create custom websites. Basically, while HTML lays the groundwork for your website or app, PHP takes it to the next level. If you're looking to learn a coding language in 2020, go for the dynamic and powerful PHP with this four-course Essential PHP Coding Bundle. Read more...

If you feel like your CV is getting tossed to the side before it even has a fighting chance, you could be right. Many recruiters and recruitment algorithms are looking for incredibly specific skills and experience, and the more relevant ones you can take on, the better your chances. One tool you shouldn't gloss over is Microsoft Access. 

The software boasts various functions that help companies store records and access data, making it an especially crucial tool if you work with massive spreadsheets on a daily basis. It offers a variety of visualisation tools that will help you make sense of all your data, too, such as tables and reports. And because it is part of the Microsoft suite of products, merging information from one platform to Access, such as exporting a report to Excel, is a breeze. Read more...

Physicists from Leiden University have 3D-printed a miniature version of an Intrepid-class starship from Star Trek (via PC Gamer). The idea of a tiny starship is probably something you haven’t considered outside of the plot of a Star Trek episode, but this microscopic model is actually part of a larger research experiment the physicists published in the scientific journal Soft Matter.
The five micrometer long ship looks like the USS Voyager and was microprinted by the physicists for their microswimmer research. Unlike the impulse engines and warp drive of its TV counterpart, this Voyager is propelled through liquid by chemical reactions between its platinum coating and the hydrogen peroxide solution the physicists placed it in.

Twitter is warning users about misleading tweets from Philadelphia’s polling locations, offering an early preview of how it will handle the rest of the night. The platform has already restricted a tweet from Trump’s director of election day operations, Mike Roman, among others. 
“Misinformation being spread online has driven more calls to the Election Task Force hotline than actual incidents at polling sites,” complained the Philadelphia District Attorney’s Office to New York Times reporter Nick Corasaniti.
Roman posted a video showing a woman in Philadelphia apparently returning multiple ballots to a dropbox and claimed Democrats were “trying to STEAL THE ELECTION in broad daylight.” But Philadelphia DAO spokeswoman Jane Roh noted that...

The Pixel 5 is one of several flagship phones to offer a reverse wireless charging feature, but Google’s done something particularly clever with its implementation of the feature here: whenever you plug in a USB-C cable, your Pixel 5 will automatically turn on its reverse wireless charging feature, effectively turning it into a Qi charging pad, as spotted by 9to5Google.
Google is pretty smart about how it handles the automated feature: according to a support doc, Battery Share will only turn on for “a short period.” If the phone detects another Qi-compatible device has been placed on top to charge, it’ll work as usual, otherwise it’ll automatically turn Battery Share off. 


This doesn’t mean that you can’t use reverse wireless charging...

In the last year, the number of streaming platforms has really gotten out of hand. There’s Hulu, Netflix, Amazon Prime, HBO Max, Disney Plus, Apple TV Plus, CBS All Access (soon to be Paramount Plus), and Peacock — and each of them has different pricing tiers. If you scored free trials for Disney Plus and Apple TV Plus, like I did, you probably got to sample a healthy selection of them. Those trials, however, are starting to wind down. Which means it’s time to figure out what’s worth keeping and what’s worth ditching: with this many monthly bills, you should absolutely play favorites. I was surprised to learn mine was HBO Max. 
HBO Max isn’t particularly well-defined. (It’s HBO… and more?) It has baffling holes in its catalog thanks to...

The game is very cleverly done. The stream shows the crossword and the clues. Users type in responses to clues in the chat, and then the puzzle will select that clue and fill in the answer. For example, somebody typing “29d ark” essentially translates to “the answer to 29 down is ‘ark,’” and the game can select that clue and type out the answer in the crossword itself. And the whole thing is backed by an extremely chill instrumental soundtrack.

The US will formally leave the landmark Paris climate agreement on November 4th, turning its back on the rest of the world as it comes together to stop climate change. How quickly the US takes on the planetary crisis will hinge on the results of today’s election.
The Paris Agreement entered into force nearly four years ago today, on November 4th, 2016, after being adopted by every nation on Earth.

A text message campaign is targeting people in Michigan with misinformation about “ballot sensor issues.” The messages claim a “typographical error” is causing people who voted for Joe Biden to have their votes switched to President Trump, and people who voted for Trump to have their votes switched to Biden, according to The Washington Post. The hoax message claims to be coming from the FBI. 
Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel warned voters the text messages are fake. “Dearborn voters, text messages are reportedly being sent to trick you into thinking there are ballot sensor issues,” she tweeted. “Do not fall for it, it’s a trick!”

Election Day is here, and in the next few days or weeks, we’ll know who won — but for lots of people, tonight isn’t just about choosing the next president. It’s also a stress test for online platforms and a measure of how carefully they can handle information when the stakes are this high.

Apple’s upcoming iPhone 12 mini will charge slower over the company’s new MagSafe wireless charger than the other iPhone 12 models, according to a newly updated Apple support document (via MacRumors).
The iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro, and the forthcoming iPhone 12 Pro Max all get charging speeds of up to 15W over MagSafe, but the iPhone 12 mini is limited to charging speeds of up to 12W. While that maximum 12W power delivery might come as a disappointment, it’s still faster than the 7.5W of charging you’d get if you dropped the iPhone 12 mini on a standard Qi wireless charger. 
The iPhone 12 mini otherwise has the same specs as the iPhone 12, including Apple’s A14 Bionic chip, a dual-camera system, and support for 5G networks, but all packed...

With one off-the-cuff tweet last month, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) proved how much politics had changed throughout the 2020 election.
“Anyone want to play Among Us with me on Twitch to get out the vote? (I’ve never played but it looks like a lot of fun),” she tweeted on October 19th.
Later that week, AOC played the game with some of the most popular streamers on Twitch. The Twitch stream ran for around three hours late at night, drawing more than 400,000 concurrent viewers at its peak. Twelve popular Twitch faces, from Hasan Piker and Pokimane to Corpse Husband and DrLupo, rotated in and out of the game and looped in their average of 5 million followers each as they did.

In the recent teardown of the iPhone 12 by iFixit, it was found that the new phone runs into some issues if a user replaces the camera module, basically rendering the cameras on the device unusable if not replaced by an Apple-authorized repair provider. 
iFixit has frequently spoken out against the control consumer electronics companies have for repairing their products, advocating for policy changes for the right to repair. In a recent post on its site, it questions whether the iPhone 12 is the “end of the repairable iPhone.”
In this week’s final episode of our limited-run podcast series on tech review season, The Vergecast’s Dieter Bohn talks with iFixit’s Kyle Wiens and Kay-Kay Clapp about their thoughts on the repairability of...

We might like to think that we are all deeply complex individuals, but we're actually pretty simple creatures. In the summer, when the sun is shining and temperatures soar, we are more content to remain single. We socialise more, meet new people, and enjoy the feeling of being untethered. However, as we enter the colder months, we yearn for companionship. It’s a fact. It’s science. It’s instinct.  Read more...

Just about everyone who's paying attention is burned out and bummed out, and it was often clear that comedians and writers were struggling to come up with witty new ways to say ""This is not normal."" (If you saw Late Night's interminable Sea Captain bits starring an oil painting in Seth Meyers' in-laws' den, then you know.)

But in a year that was constantly, genuinely terrifying — from the crumbling of our democratic institutions to a global pandemic — and also often deeply absurd, late night shows reinvented themselves. Suddenly transported to garages and home offices, the late night shows managed to create moments that found clarity, lightness, edification, and yes, laughs, in the bleak pandemic-election hellscape.  Read more...

And while Donald Trump spent his last hours on the campaign trail trashing random celebrities, late night show hosts took time to reflect on the last four years — in particular, the many lies, abuses of power, and scandals that have characterized the president's time in office.

On Late Night, Seth Meyers rounded off his monologue (jump to 14:55 in the video below) with a fast rundown of America's present under Trump's leadership, and the many lowlights of his time in the White House. ""Trump can't run on reality so he has to run against it, because the reality is that after four years of serial cruelties, absurdities, lies, and abuses of power, he's left the nation in ruins,"" Meyers said, before launching into one staggering list.

Waymo is pulling its autonomous vehicles out of San Francisco in anticipation of Election Day unrest, The Verge has learned. 
The Google spinoff is “temporarily pausing” its AV test operations in San Francisco on Tuesday and Wednesday and moving its fleet to Mountain View, where it will be parked in a “secured location,” according to an email from Transdev, Waymo’s fleet operations vendor. 
The decision was made “out of an abundance of caution ahead of some of the planned protests around the general election,” Chris Cheung, general manager at Transdev North America, wrote in the email obtained by The Verge. 
Two Waymo safety drivers told The Verge they got the word midday on Monday to manually drive their autonomous vehicles from San...

It was always a lie, of course. Google didn’t know Trump would be announcing such a thing, and while another subsidiary of the search giant’s parent company was working on a testing website, it was nothing worth announcing to the American public during a nationwide briefing at a time of crisis.

Have you voted? That’s really important. Go do that, if you haven’t already. These deals will be here when you get back.
Now then, Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Live wireless earbuds — lovingly referred to as “beans” for their design — are $30 off at Amazon and Best Buy. If you’ve been waiting to take the plunge on these, you should know that this is within $5 of their best price yet. Both retailers have every color available at this cost, including black, bronze, red, and white. My colleague Chris Welch reviewed them (while Becca Farsace provided the video above), and the main takeaways here are that they might be Samsung’s best wireless earbuds yet. They have a bold design, lengthy battery life, and good sound quality. The Galaxy Buds Live...

As it did with mobile, T-Mobile is trumpeting the service’s relatively cheap pricing (although it remains to be seen whether T-Mobile will actually be able to maintain those $10 and $40 price points long term). But when it comes to actually using the TVision apps, the experience is about as basic as it gets.
I spent a few days trying out TVision on both an iPad and T-Mobile’s branded Android TV dongle, the TVision Hub. Both apps are virtually identical, splitting up the main navigation into...

If you’re now working at home, if your kids are now learning at home, if you’re just stuck at home and looking for a good computing experience, you may be in the market for a new laptop. Unfortunately — especially for those who need to watch their pennies — tech isn’t cheap.

For a more practical illustration of what “brittleness” means, though, simply consider the case of the AI camera operator deployed by Scottish soccer team Inverness Caledonian Thistle FC. When the pandemic stopped fans attending matches, the club announced it would live stream its games, using an automatic camera system with “in-built, AI, ball-tracking technology” to make sure people always get the best view of the action.

The pandemic has taken many things from the world — but mostly it’s stolen events. Every hang is a potential death sentence. Thankfully, Twitch, at least, has gone virtual: it announced today that its flagship conference, TwitchCon, will be happening online this year. Oh, and it’s not called TwitchCon. It’s now GlitchCon, and it’s happening on November 14th. 
Because no fun was ever had by NOT going into an interdimensional portal.

In a nearly two-minute ad called ""Absentee,"" Hamill gives the American people a crash course in political history and delivers a crucial last-minute reminder: ""Elections have consequences.""

In a press release, the political action committee (founded by former Republican strategists in 2019) detailed the importance of casting a ballot in the 2020 election — be it in person or absentee.

Hamill reminds viewers that America's voting history is a troubled one, and notes that Donald Trump's administration continually seeks to delegitimize mail-in and absentee ballots across the country. Read more...

AMC Entertainment didn’t try to hide the immense financial duress the company has faced the last several months and the increasingly uncertain future that lies ahead if AMC can’t find new ways to make cash. 
The company posted a revenue of $119.5 million in its third quarter, down 91 percent year over year. The same quarter last year brought in more than $1 billion. AMC noted in its earnings that it’s “operating approximately 539 of its 600 domestic locations,” as of October 2020, but cities like New York City and Los Angeles remain big obstacles. The issue is getting people into those theaters on a consistent basis without any big movies to encourage attendance. On Monday, the company also filed new documents stating it was trying to...

Neither company would tell The Verge any real details about what this means for TikTok users. For the most part, it seems like things will largely stay the same. But that’s still an important development: TikTok has been working toward cutting new details with the major record groups since it exploded in popularity to ensure that it doesn’t lose some of the world’s top songs, and this appears to be the first deal locked in.

Anthony Fauci is probably one of the most recognizable faces of the coronavirus pandemic in the US. So when a public health expert needed a way to measure how her students were coping with all of the stresses of 2020, she created a chart to gauge their “level of Fauci.”

This is also the 12th hurricane to form this season, which has only happened three times before, according to Phil Klotzbach, a research scientist in the Department of Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University.  
2020 has been exceptionally active
The World Meteorological Organization ran out of names on its alphabetical list in mid-September, with more than two months left in the 2020 season. That forced the agency to turn to Greek letters for storm names for just the second time in its history....

Spotify’s going to test letting artists and labels influence more of what its algorithm promotes. The company announced today a new test for all artists and labels on the platform where they can decide to promote any music that’s important to them. So, for example, if Fleetwood Mac wanted to promote “Dreams” after it went viral on TikTok, they could decide to do so, and Spotify’s algorithm would consider that request when building a radio session or when a listener enters autoplay. Of course, this could apply to any song, including tracks that might be new or that artists want to put extra promotional push behind.
“We want to be able to provide tools that help our artists leverage those moments, so they can be more in control of their...

OnePlus has revealed a wild-looking Cyberpunk 2077-themed 8T, and it looks radically different from the standard OnePlus 8T. Disappointingly, though, the Cyberpunk 2077-themed phone is only available to preorder in China at the moment, where it costs CNY 3,999 (a little less than $600).
The phone has a lot of cosmetic touches to match the visual tone of the upcoming game, such as striking yellow accents and a Cyberpunk 2077 logo on the bottom of the phone. But the thing I can’t stop looking at is its giant camera module, which encompasses much of the width of the back of the phone.

The line includes cases and a broad selection of mounts that’ll let you attach a variety of things to your iPhone 12, or your iPhone 12 to a variety of things. 
Moment’s products don’t carry Apple’s Made for iPhone branding, but the company says it’s developed a magnet array of its own called “(M)Force” that provides extra strength. Magnets aren’t proprietary, of course, so anyone can make products that physically attach to the iPhone 12.

Ever since then, there have always been a handful of humans living and working in orbit on the ISS — a continuous presence of people in space.
Prior to that mission, most of NASA’s human spaceflight program revolved around launching relatively quick, weeks-long trips to orbit on the agency’s Space Shuttle. But in the mid-1990s, NASA began sending its astronauts to space for much longer trips to live on Russia’s old Mir space station. Once the US, Russia, and their international partners started piecing together the International Space Station, NASA started sending some of its astronauts to stay for months at a time...

Epic on Monday revealed new information about what performance benefits Fortnite players should expect day one if playing the game on the new PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X / S consoles, all of which launch next week. We already knew some of these — specifically the 4K and 60 frames per second targets — but Epic is also detailing some behind-the-scenes upgrades the new hardware should allow for.

Bridgerton — which looks like an extra-horny Georgian Gossip Girl — takes place in London high society, where Daphne Bridgerton (Phoebe Dynevor) is looking for a husband. Her efforts are hindered by Lady Whistledown (voiced in the trailer by Julie Andrews!), who is determined to expose any dirt about the season's singles and positively lives for the drama. Will Daphne survive her century's gossip column? Will she love or hate the Duke of Hastings (Regé-Jean Page) — or both?

Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It’s never a bad idea to wait until there’s a good deal, and thankfully, those happen with some regularity. The latest model, the Apple Watch Series 6, starts at $399. Despite launching in September, it already has a small price reduction. If that’s a little too expensive, you can drop at least another $120 off the price by buying an Apple Watch SE, which also launched last month. 
Of course, the Series 3 is less expensive option, too, as it is the most affordable Apple Watch model to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. Regardless of which model you choose, all three models do support watchOS 7. If you’re looking for something to last a few years,...

If you have limited space for leisure but don't want to be bored all holiday season long, it's time to get creative.

We're talking about a little game called ping-pong. With the PingPongly retractable table tennis set, you can turn any table into a ping-pong table — indoors or out. Set up family tournaments or simply practice to defeat your siblings down the line. Nothing like a little friendly competition to get you in the holiday spirit.

This set includes a retractable ping-pong net with rubber grips, which can be clipped onto your table. (It'll work for tables up to two inches thick and 720 inches wide.) You're welcome to BYOP (bring your own paddle) if you choose, but the set also comes with two red paddles, three ping-pong balls, and a carrying case. Read more...

You could spend hours researching the perfect gift, and then get totally overshadowed by an expert offering something incredibly fun, personal, and touching. 

It's frustrating, but it doesn't need to be this way. You can hack the system with digital gifts and subscriptions. Your rivals might come up with something special, but your gift will keep on giving long after the competition.

The serious problem with this obsession is that many wannabe chefs aren't able to source tasty ingredients, let alone have the time to create something that's actually worth eating. We just don't seem to have the time or energy to prepare exciting meals anymore, and that's a terrible shame. Read more...

The following are reviews of various speakers and headsets (both headphones and earbuds) that will allow you to really enjoy your playlist. Read on, and see if you can’t find something that will fit your needs perfectly.

Redditor Skramblez has created a custom map for Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater that turns Harry Potter's school of witchcraft and wizardry into a skate park. The Great Hall, a classroom that looks like Professor Flitckwick's Charms classroom, a tower that could very well be the Divination Tower, and the surrounding courtyards and rooftops have been turned into arenas for clocking up kickflips.

Take a tour through the map to the dulcet tones of a metal version of John Williams' score in this video, where three skaters with skins to resemble Harry, Ron, and Hermione do some serious wizardry. Draco Malfoy also turns up, but his run is a short one.  Read more...

Enter John Oliver. The Last Week Tonight host has previously criticized the president's early response to the pandemic, as well as his handling of testing — but in the video above, he breaks down everything that Trump got wrong.

As you might imagine, it's a long list. And after talking in depth about Trump's chaotic European travel ban, his administration's delays in securing PPE, and his bungled communication and outright lies about the virus, Oliver admits that 20 minutes isn't nearly enough time to cover the president's mismanagement of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Do you have one good knife you reach for when cutting literally everything? Do you panic when it's in the dishwasher, and you've got dinner to prep? Been there, done that.

We're not judging — but it could be time to level up our cookware accessories and, you know, have more than one good knife in your drawer. Especially with many of us spending the holidays at home this year, that Thanksgiving dinner is going to require a little more than a single knife to get the job done.

The Trump clip that plays elicits an immediate and vociferous round of boos from SNL's live studio audience. Which doesn't usually happen. It may have something to do with the fact that SNL's studio audience this season is intentionally making room for health care workers, who have been laboring on the front lines of this terrible pandemic since March.

The deep ocean — particularly the twilight zone, a dark realm extending some 660 to 3,300 feet below the surface — is little known and woefully unexplored. When navigating the depths in submersibles or using remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), marine biologists can spot rarely (or never) seen creatures. In late October, a Schmidt Ocean Institute expedition filmed the Spirula spirula floating vertically at some 2,850 feet underwater.

""Exciting news!"" the institute, which explores the ocean, tweeted on Oct. 27. ""This appears to be the FIRST observation of Spirula, aka ram's horn squid, alive + in its natural environment. Very rarely seen or captured, they have many extinct relatives, but are only living member of genus Spirula, family Spirulidae, and order Spirulida."" Read more...

Hm. ""Happy"" may be a bit too much in this, the year of our shared pandemic. But it is Oct. 31, the day of Halloween, and a little lockdown isn't going to stop people from dressing up. Especially since social media exists.

It may not be as easy to go trick-or-treating in 2020, but that doesn't mean we can't appreciate all the hard work that went into crafting inventive costumes. People are still dressing up this year, and they're doing a bang-up job of it.

This is nothing more than an appreciation post for all the super Halloween costumes we won't get to see on the local streets in 2020. And that's a good thing! It means people are staying safe. Just wear a mask, be a responsible community member, and keep kicking ass.

The latest service offering from the so-called ""Un-Carrier"" is TVision, a streaming linear TV alternative along the lines of YouTube TV, Hulu with Live TV, and Fubo. While those other services have arguably gone astray with incessant price hikes after lofty early promises, TVision's channel packages are intended to be more competitively priced.

On top of that, T-Mobile is selling a $50 streaming device called the Hub. It's supposed to be optimized for TVision, including a special remote with TVision-specific button shortcuts on it. This could be an enticing bundle of service and product for folks who want the benefits of cable without a hefty bill. So is TVision the next step for cable alternatives, or does it need some more time in the oven? Read more...

The Post examined posts and ad spending along with internal Facebook documents. It found accounts that included Donald Trump Jr. and a pro-Trump super PAC were shielded from the platform’s most serious enforcement actions. For instance, according to the Post, Facebook removed a strike against Trump Jr. on Instagram — which is owned by Facebook— that would have led to him being labeled a “repeat offender” and could have meant a permanent ban under platform rules.

Once you get past the fact that it has no skin, the new robot from Disney Research is an impressive feat of robotics. First reported by Gizmodo, the new robot can imitate human facial movements, specifically blinking and subtle head movements. 
A sensor in its chest area (covered by a shirt, because the face is unsettling enough, thanks) alerts the robot when to turn and face a person in front of it, and its eye movements shift from direct eye contact to the rapid eye movements known as saccades. It also moves slightly up and down to mimic breathing.


The robot was developed by engineers at Disney’s Research division, Walt Disney Imagineering, and robotics researchers from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign and the California...

I have only watched the new episode of The Mandalorian once (so far) but it is so great to have this fun, nerdy show back. I won’t spoil anything but it was A) nice to see The Baby aka Baby Yoda aka my green son, B) nice to see Timothy Olyphant and C) great to see the coolest show on streaming is still very, very cool. Check out the review of the first episode here, and look for weekly Friday recaps of new episodes on The Verge. 
This week’s trailers include the new season of the other best show on streaming: The Crown. Look I have eclectic tastes, OK?

With just a few days to go before the November 3rd presidential election, former Vice President Joe Biden’s campaign has launched a new custom map in Fortnite. First reported by Mashable, the “Build Back Better with Biden” map is located in “Reboot City,” and is aimed at promoting the campaign’s message that the environment and economy are connected. The solo-player, adventure-type map takes about 20 to 30 minutes to play, and made its debut Friday night. 
“Our digital program is built around how people spend time, and the most effective ways reach them in those places,” Christian Tom, the Biden campaign’s director of digital partnerships said in a statement to The Verge. “We see interactive, digital-first experiences like gaming as an...

A jury in Texas has ruled that Apple has to pay VirnetX $502.8 million in royalties for VPN on Demand, a feature that lets iOS users access a VPN connection, Bloomberg reported. The two companies have been involved in a legal battle for ten years, with VirnetX— sometimes referred to as a patent troll — arguing that Apple’s VPN on Demand and FaceTime use its technology.
Apple said in a statement it plans to appeal the decision: “This case has been going on for over a decade, with patents that are unrelated to the core operations of our products and have been found to be invalid by the patent office. Cases like this only serve to stifle innovation and harm consumers.”
Earlier this year, a US appeals court rejected Apple’s request to...

Outside of excited Apple executives, no one thought much of Apple TV Plus. Even with $6 billion allocated for content and a roster of talent that included J.J. Abrams, Reese Witherspoon, and Oprah Winfrey, little on Apple TV Plus shined at launch. With the exception of The Morning Show, Apple TV Plus barely managed to enter the conversation, while other new entrants like Disney Plus soared right out the gate. 
But streaming isn’t a sprint; it’s a marathon. The anniversary of Apple TV Plus arrives with the platform getting better each month, but it’s still not where Apple needs it to be.  
It’s impossible to ignore the most obvious flailing that Apple TV Plus is facing: there’s no back catalog to keep people around once they’ve finished...

This year at Pudong Football Stadium in Shanghai, the ceremony was split into a few different parts: it opened with virtual K-pop group K/DA performed via augmented reality, which was followed by a melody of anthems from past Worlds events. At the end, as the players were introduced, a virtual, towering version of League character Galio — known as the stone colossus — appeared on stage.
While the event wasn’t as visually impressive as last year’s holographic showcase, it was still an impressive feat considering the restraints created by the ongoing pandemic. The main cast of performers were virtual, but they...

Bad news for shareholders, sure, but the company’s short sellers are likely over the moon — unlike Tesla’s. Intel stock fell nearly 14% in the 30 days preceding October 28, during which time the total value of the company’s shorts fell by nearly $1.35 billion, which is the biggest decrease of any top shorted stocks on the market.
