Activation Sparsity in Transformer Models for Improved Interpretability
Overview
Transformer models, renowned for their superior performance in natural language processing tasks, often grapple with challenges tied to their intricate, dense architectures â€” a lack of clear interpretability. This project explores a recent discovery from October 2022 that highlights activation sparsity within transformer models, a phenomenon that might be the key to unlocking clearer model interpretability.

Activation Sparsity: An Introduction
Activation sparsity is characterized by a model's neurons remaining inactive, enabling the model to present a sparse representation of input data. This not only emphasizes the crucial input features essential for the model's predictions but also paves the way for a clearer understanding of the internal workings of the model.

Research Objectives
Our investigation dives deep into:

Understanding what activation sparsity represents within the transformer architecture.
Evaluating its influence on model interpretability.
Proposed Approach
We've innovated upon the existing transformer architecture to incorporate activation sparsity seamlessly into its self-attention mechanism.

Experimental Evaluation
Our empirical studies, conducted using Hugging Face's renowned T5 encoder-decoder model across multiple supervised learning tasks, have revealed:

An enhancement in model interpretability, without compromising on performance.
A notably higher influence of activation sparsity on interpretability for intricate tasks, such as machine translation.
Key Implications
Our results shine a light on the transformative power of activation sparsity in model design, underscoring its potential in advancing transformer model interpretability.
